# Pluto-Charon CR3BP
This project simulates trajectories in the Pluto-Charon system using the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). Includes all figures + raw code.

REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING PYTHON LIBRARIES TO RUN:
* numpy
* matplotlib

To install dependencies, download and extract the repo zip file, then ```cd``` to the folder containing ```requirements.txt``` on Command Prompt, and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
