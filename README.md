# Pluto-Charon CR3BP
This project simulates trajectories in the Pluto-Charon system using the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). Includes all figures + raw code.

REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING PYTHON LIBRARIES TO RUN:
* numpy
* matplotlib

To install dependencies, cd to the folder containing ```requirements.txt``` on Command Prompt, and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then download and extract the repo zip file, and run the demo available in cr3bp_master.py.
Keep in mind, the master file only runs the horseshoe figures. For the remaining figures, 
follow the instructions in the ```src``` files.
